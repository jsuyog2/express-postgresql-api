## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jsuyog2/express-postgresql-api.git
   cd express-postgresql-api
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project. Configure the environment variables as described in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables).

## Usage

### Run Locally

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```


## Build

To build the project using Webpack, use the following commands:

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
  npm run build
```

This command will generate the bundled files optimized for production in the `dist` directory.

### Start the Server

After building the project, you can start the server with:

```bash
  npm run prod
```

This command builds the project (if not already built) and then starts the server using the generated `bundle.js` file in the `dist` directory.

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you need to configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

- **`PRODUCTION`**: Set to `true` for production mode or `false` for development mode.
- **`BASE_URL`**: The base URL for the application (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000`).
- **`PORT`**: The port on which the application will run (e.g., `3000`).
- **`CORS_LIST`**: Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`).
- **`JWT_SECRET`**: Secret key for signing JWT tokens.
- **`JWT_PUBLICKEY_PATH`**: Path to the public key file for JWT verification.
- **`JWT_PRIVATEKEY_PATH`**: Path to the private key file for JWT signing.
- **`SESSION_SECRET`**: Secret key used for session management.
- **`PG_CONNECT`**: Connection string for PostgreSQL database (e.g., `postgres://postgres:1234@localhost/pgtest`).
- **`MAIL_HOST`**: SMTP server host for sending emails.
- **`MAIL_PORT`**: SMTP server port for sending emails (e.g., `465`).
- **`MAIL_USERNAME`**: SMTP server username.
- **`MAIL_PASSWORD`**: SMTP server password.

Hereâ€™s an example `.env` file with the required variables:

```dotenv
PRODUCTION=false
BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
PORT=3000
CORS_LIST=http://localhost:4200

JWT_SECRET=api_secret_key
JWT_PUBLICKEY_PATH=E:/Clouds/express-postgresql-api/key/public.key
JWT_PRIVATEKEY_PATH=E:/Clouds/express-postgresql-api/key/private.key

SESSION_SECRET=api_session_secret

PG_CONNECT=postgres://postgres:1234@localhost/pgtest

MAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_USERNAME=example@example.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
```

Ensure that you replace the placeholder values with your actual configuration details.

## Generating Keys Using OpenSSL

Now you need to create Private and Public Key to generate a Token.

1. **Generate an RSA private key, of size 2048, and output it to a file named `private.key`:**

   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out key/private.key 2048
   ```

2. **Extract the public key from the key pair, which can be used in a certificate:**

   ```bash
   openssl rsa -in key/private.key -outform PEM -pubout -out key/public.key
   ```

   **Note:** Make sure both `key/private.key` and `key/public.key` are saved in the `key` folder.
